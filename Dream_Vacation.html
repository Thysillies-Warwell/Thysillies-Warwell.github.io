  <h1>Dream Vacation: Sicily</h1>

    <p>There are a few reasons as to why I would love to visit Sicily Italy. My family has roots from Sicily Italy on my grandmothers side of the family. I would visit her on christmas and we would go over to the church and celebrate with Sicilian customs.</p>

    <p>Reason 2 is every picture and video i have seen that shows off that Sicilian coast line has always been beautiful and stunning. </p>

    <p>The last reason I would love to go to Sicily is for the food. There is no better place o the plannet to get food at other than Italy (or so Ive been told)</p>
