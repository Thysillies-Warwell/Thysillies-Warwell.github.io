                <p>The Necron Codex is a somewhat thick book containing all the different Necrons you can buy and their individual stat sheets. It also contains information and history about the Necron faction. The reason I want it is simple, I love the concept of the undead and since I am getting into Warhammer 40k, I would like to know more about the Necron faction.</p>
