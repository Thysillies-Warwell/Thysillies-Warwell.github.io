                <h4>A Warhammer 40k Necron Codex:</h4>
                <p>The Necron Codex is a somewhat thick book containing all the different Necrons you can buy and their individual stat sheets. It also contains information and history about the Necron faction. The reason I want it is simple, I love the concept of the undead and since I am getting into Warhammer 40k, I would like to know more about the Necron faction.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>An apartment:</h4>
                <p>Just a simple apartment with decent rent and space. I want to have a better sence of independance, a better feeling of being responsible for myself, and an area to call my own.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>A 1969 dodge charger:</h4>
                <p>It is a simple 1969 dodge charger, similar to the one fro mthe fast and the furious. I have been enamored with the sleek body of this car ever since I first saw it online back in 8th grade. I, in fact, did not first see it in the fast and furious. That came later on and only cemented my love. Didnt care much for the film though.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>A Registeel Pokemon card:</h4>
                <p>It is a Pokemon card of Registeel. My favorite legendary pokemon are the Regi family (excluding regidraco and regileki. They feel like the step child cousins of theRregi family.) I already have a card of Regigigas, and now I am seeking my second favorite Regi, Registeel.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>A Nerf Rhino Fire:</h4>
                <p>The nerf Rhino Fire is a tripod mounted, dual barreled, automated fire, 100 round capacity, minigun. It can be taken off of its tripod and carried with an overhead handle. I had one back in the day and did not use it to its full potential. Now that I have grown up and understand true action hero aura, I will be able to properly utalize it for bpth fantastic fashion and efficient takedown of enemies.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>A Steam Deck:</h4>
                <p>A steam deck is a hand held mini computer/cosole made by valve, the owners/creators of steam. I works just like a mini computer with 16 gig ram and up to 1 tb of storage. This would help me out alot with gaming and storage management as I would be able to run some of my smaller, lighter games off of it while running more intese games off my computer, allowing me to free up some storage and game on the go much more easily.</p>
